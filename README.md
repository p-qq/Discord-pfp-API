# Updates
This is an update as of 12/22/2021, I haven't been working on the api as much only just a few days but I have a video um dont mind the music https://streamable.com/vmlp3t i usually just listen to music while I code, and I haven been using next.js which I found pretty good so far and a perfect choice.

# Discord-pfp-API
This will be a future project, so far I have over 30k+ pfps and i am planning to make an api for discord pfps
# if you want to send me you pfps in bulks then you can dm me
or you can contact me on `offer#0001` or you can find me in the support server on groovebot.tk or in .gg/xavine.
