# Updates as of 2/19/2022
I have added User Accs you can login with gmail, planning on adding discord towards the future, I also added a better searching system, users can also upload pfps and save pfps from other users. Added more catagories, reworked the website and css made it look a lot better. Reworked the masonry css so images can fit better, userprofiles are now a thing, you can also see information on images so for those ppl who want to scrape in the future are open to scrape my website for pfps. last but not least if you want to be part of the people who upload in the early beta of the website dm my account and you can have access to the website  ***<--- Updates HERE***
